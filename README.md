# bookkeeper-permissions

This experimental library adds permissions to
[bookkeeper](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bookkeeper) records. Its
intended purpose is to be used as a building block in other libraries
providing general access to data in some form or other (database bindings,
web servers etc).
